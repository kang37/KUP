It is the code for my research project, Kyoto Urban Biodiversity, which focus on the plant diversity in the built-up area of Kyoto city. 
The manuscript *Dispersed green contributes to urban biodiversity: plant diversity across land use and scales in an Asian city* has been accepted to the *Journal of Forestry Research*.  
If anyone is interested in urban biodiversity research, do not hesitate to contact me or star the repo, please. 

I also evaluated the ecosystem services of Kyoto city (see my repo named KES). 
Now I am working on the link between urban biodiversity and ecosystem services.
